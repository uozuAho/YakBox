YakBox
======

A YakBak emulator for Android. Record sounds, play them back in forward
and reverse, at various speeds.

# Bugs
- Recording & rotating device can sometimes cause crash, then can't
  reopen app until after reboot (can't init audio record).
    + Sometimes this happens even without rotating the device

# Todo
- follow http://developer.android.com/training/appbar/setting-up.html
- share: email, facebook, twitter etc.
- options / settings
    + normalise recordings
    + strip silence @ start & end
- delete multiple recordings
- load/save as icons?
