YakBox
======

A YakBak emulator for Android. Record sounds, play them back in forward
and reverse, at various speeds.

# Bugs
- Recording & rotating device can sometimes cause crash, then can't
  reopen app until after reboot (can't init audio record).
    + Sometimes this happens even without rotating the device

# Todo
- options / settings
    + think of some options...colour scheme?
    + normalise recordings
- send / receive yaks
- delete multiple recordings
- load/save as icons?
